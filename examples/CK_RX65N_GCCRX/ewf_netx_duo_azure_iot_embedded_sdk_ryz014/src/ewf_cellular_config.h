On the right side, each column corresponds to each confirmed board number.

Note:
Please supply power source to USB(CN4) port on RYZ014A/RYZ024A-PMOD.
E2 emulator supplying power to RYZ014A/RYZ024A-PMOD may result in insufficient power source.
The E2 emulator can provide 200mA, but RYZ014A/RYZ024A needs more current while connecting to the network.
