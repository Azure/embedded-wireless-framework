Overview
========
This is a small demo of the high-performance ThreadX kernel. It includes
examples of eight threads of different priorities, using a message queue,
semaphore, mutex, event flags group, byte pool, and block pool. Please
refer to Chapter 6 of the ThreadX User Guide for a complete description
of this demonstration.
